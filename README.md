# Bank-System using C++ using OOP.

I am pleased to share that my program boasts an intuitive Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) structure for user-friendly navigation. Robust user administration facilitates secure transactions such as deposits and withdrawals, with a transfer log to track these activities.

Moreover, the program includes a currency converter for seamless financial operations. Security is paramount, and to ensure confidentiality, passwords are encrypted within the files. The system also maintains a comprehensive log register, capturing user activities along with date and time stamps.

Best regards,

- Rayyan Alomari.
